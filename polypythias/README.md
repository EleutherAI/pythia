## PolyPythias: Stability and Outliers across Fifty Language Model Pre-Training Runs

To recreate the plots in the paper [PolyPythias: Stability and Outliers across Fifty Language Model Pre-Training Runs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bmrYu2Ekdz), download the evaluations available on the Hugging Face Hub at [huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/polypythias-evals](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/polypythias-evals) into the `/data` subfolder. To reproduce the training map plot, we add the `training_maps.tsv` file here on GitHub.

`/training-maps` contains an implementation of [Latent State Models of Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09543) by Hu et al. (2023) used for inducing the HMM Training Maps.

Before running the notebook, make sure to download the required packages listed in the first cell of the notebook.
