National prevention strategies have identified the need to reduce suicide risk in this population. However, research on specific risk factors for LGB young people that might inform suicide prevention programmes are at an early stage of development.<|endoftext|>Introduction {#Sec1}\\n============\\n\\nThe early endosome (EE) is an organelle in the endocytic pathway in filamentous fungi that is constantly moved along the microtubule (MT) by two motor proteins, kinesin and dynein^[@CR1]^. The molecular mechanisms underlying how EEs exhibit motility have been intensely investigated in the model filamentous fungi *Ustilago maydis* and *Aspergillus nidulans* ^[@CR2],[@CR3]^. The motility of filamentous fungal EEs was first visualized in *U. maydis* with Yup1, a soluble *N*-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE), in cells that were also stained with the endocytic marker dye FM4-64^[@CR4]^. Subsequent studies have characterized the EE-specific small GTPase Rab5 in several filamentous fungi^[@CR5]--[@CR7]^. Rab5-positive EEs move along bipolar MT arrays: movement to the plus-ends is mediated by kinesin-3, whereas that to the minus-ends is mediated by dynein, which enables long-range EE motility throughout the hyphal cell^[@CR8]^.\\n\\nBecause motor proteins driven by ATPase activity support constant EE motility, cells constitutively consume an abundance of energy. Therefore, it has been speculated that EE motility is likely to have versatile physiological roles in living cells. Analyses in *U. maydis* have revealed that EE motility supports the \"hitchhiking\" of certain molecules, such as septin mRNAs and ribosomes^[@CR9],[@CR10]^. Moreover, not only molecules but also organelles, such as peroxisomes (POs) and lipid droplets (LDs), can hitchhike via EE motility^[@CR11],[@CR12]^. Furthermore, it has been suggested that EEs can transduce pathogenic cues from the infecting hyphal tip to the nucleus^[@CR13]^. Thus, constantly moving EEs indeed have several biological roles. As a result, there might be as yet unidentified roles of EE motility in other filamentous fungi.\\n\\nRecently, Hook, a linker protein between EEs and motor proteins, has been identified together with accessory proteins FHIP and FTS in both *U. maydis* and *A. nidulans* ^[@CR14]--[@CR16]^. When Hook is deleted, EE motility is abolished and the distribution of other organelles is also impaired: for example, POs and LDs accumulate at the hyphal tip, whereas endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is partially retracted to the basal region^[@CR11]^. In *A. nidulans*, a linker protein, PxdA, that connects EEs and POs has also been identified^[@CR17]^. The apical accumulation of POs and LDs in the absence of Hook can be explained by polar drift caused by the myosin motor^[@CR18]^; however, the reason for ER retraction in the absence of EE motility is not clear. Furthermore, there are no detailed analyses of whether protein secretion is related to EE motility.\\n\\nIn this study, we have investigated the physiological roles of EE motility in *Aspergillus oryzae*, an industrially important fungus due to its property of abundant enzymatic protein secretion. By analyzing the disruptant of *Aohok1*, which encodes an ortholog of Hook, we confirmed that Δ*Aohok1* cells showed the same phenotypes of EE and PO distribution as observed in disruptants of *U. maydis* and *A. nidulans*. We further revealed that, without EE motility, formation of the apical secretory vesicle cluster Spitzenkörper was impaired, although the distributions of two other secretory organelles (ER and Golgi) were not affected. Moreover, we found that the transcript and protein levels of the *A. oryzae* major secretory protein α-amylase were significantly reduced in the absence of EE motility. Lastly, a lack of EE motility induced perturbation of conidial and sclerotial formations. Taken together, these results suggest that EE motility is crucial for abundant α-amylase production and proper cell differentiation in *A. oryzae*.\\n\\nResults {#Sec2}\\n=======\\n\\nCharacterization of *A. oryzae* EEs {#Sec3}\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nTo visualize the motility of EEs in *A. oryzae*, we first tried to establish an EE marker protein. In other model filamentous fungi, homologs of the small GTPase Rab5, which preferentially binds to EE membrane in its GTP form, have been characterized^[@CR5]--[@CR7]^. Thus, we conducted a BLAST search using these Rab5 homologs and identified a sole Rab5 homolog in *A. oryzae*, named AoRab5 (AO090003000619; Fig.\\xa0[1A](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). An'"
